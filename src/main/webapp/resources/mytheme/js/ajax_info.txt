Dhyan Chand (29 August Tuesday 1905 – 3 December 1979) was an Indian field hockey player, who is widely considered as the greatest field hockey player of All Time.[1] Chand is most remembered for his extraordinary goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold medals (1928, 1932, and 1936) in field hockey, during an era where India was the most dominant team in Hockey.

Known as “The Wizard” for his superb ball control, Chand played his final international match in 1948, having scored more than 400 goals[citation needed] during his international career.
